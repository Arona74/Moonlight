# Moonlight Library
Formerly Selene Library, Moonlight Lib is a set of specialized utilities and shared code that I use for my mods.
These include some highly specialized features such as dynamic asset generation, 2 new data registries, dynamic registration system as well as your usual multi loader helpers and wrappers to develop for both Fabric and Forge
